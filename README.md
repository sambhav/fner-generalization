# FNER - Oversampling

Group Project for Data Mining - 
We try to improve results for fine grained entity recognition. We first prove the hypothesis that 
undermentioned entities in the training database lead to lower accuracy when testing them.

To overcome this problem we try to oversample the data by contextually replacing the entities in sentences with entities from the same class.

We also try to experiment with undersampling to further see how changes in frequency of entities in training data affect results.
